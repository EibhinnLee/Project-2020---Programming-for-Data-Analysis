    "#### Problem statement\n",
    "Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.\n",
    "Use the numpy.random package to model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could\n",
    "collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their\n",
    "relationships with each other.\n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the\n",
    "data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some\n",
    "students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to\n",
    "base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),\n",
    "but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section\n",

    "### Dataset Info\n",
    "***\n",
    "For the purpose of the project, I manually create a dataset relating to horse racing.\n",
    "To delve deeper, I created a dataset using the top 112 Steeplechasers rated from the 2019-2020 season.\n",
    "This information can be found at the following URL with information solely taken from page 2.\n",
    "https://support.racingadmin.co.uk/opencms/export/sites/weatherbys/racing-admin-support/.galleries/racing-admin-downloads/anglo-irish-jump-classification.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind creating this dataset was two-fold, 1) I'm interested in the sport and 2) I can randomly generate data closely related to the initial dataframe that I created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables used and explained\n",
    "***\n",
    "Rating - Each racehorse that runs under the rules of racing will get a rating. If a horse has not run yet in its life, it will be restricted to certain races that will be under the same conditions for each horse until it has received a rating. Each jursdiction both sides of the Irish sea employ a team of people known as 'handicappers' who review, analyse and set ratings for racehorses. Generally, ratings are choosen by how each horse has run, the race type in ran in, the class of race, the time of the race along with other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name - Every horse is named and registered with the regulatory body. Every horse has a passport to distinguish exactly is the correct horse present on the day of the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance - for the dataset, I decided to classify this variable into three as given by the \"ANGLO-IRISH STEEPLECHASE CLASSIFICATION\". In the classification, the three groups are:\n",
    "- 2 miles 7f+ \n",
    "- 2 miles 3f to 2 miles 6.5f\n",
    "- 2 miles to 2 miles 2.5f\n",
    "\n",
    "For my dataset, I simply used:\n",
    "- Staying (2 miles 7f+)\n",
    "- Intermediate (2 miles 3f to 2 miles 6.5f)\n",
    "- Minimum (2 miles to 2 miles 2.5f)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bred - Is a straightforward variable indicating what country the horse was bred. For official purposes, this is generally provided at the end of the horses name e.g 'FR', 'GB', 'IRE'\n",
    "\n",
    "Location - is a variable I came up with to describe where the horse is trained\n",
    "\n",
    "Age - age of the horse at the time of the project. All horses will offically be 1 year older on 1st January day regardless of the month they were born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Novice -  novice is a term used to describe a horse in its first year at a discipline. In the case of the dataset, all are under the same discipline which is Steeplechase. But other disciplines are 'flat' and 'hurdles'. Generally speaking but not always the case, horses progress from flat to hurdles to steeplechases and the first year in each discipline they will be classified as a novice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sex - male or female."
