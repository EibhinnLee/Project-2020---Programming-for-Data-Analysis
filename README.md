Assignment Details
The assignment looks at creating a dataset by simulating variables.
In this case, I manually created a dataset and sumulated various variables.
The context of my project was to simulate variables related to the sport of horse racing.
The numpy.random package was used to perform this simulation and create the new dataset.
Visual representatin was used throughout the project to view the mix between the exsiting data and the new simulated data.
